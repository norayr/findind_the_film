I was searching for this film since I noticed it was cited in one youtube video, which did not mention the origin. google images, tineye, etc search did not reveal anything. after several weeks i’ve repeated the search. google brought only one link to the xml file, which was generated just in the late october and contains links to 791 screenshots.

after a couple of unsuccessful tries to extract only images list from the file with xmlstarlet, i decided to switch to more known to me tools. eventually this, of course far from being the optimal, way helped.

Then I’ve looked through all downloaded files and vouala, the film is called ‘the son’s room’.
